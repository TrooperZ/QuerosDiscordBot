# QuerosDiscordBot


**QUEROS IS DEAD!!!** It's been a long and fun run but sadly we have stalled. With the dominant space of popular bots and the rapid changes to Discord's API, I couldn't put enough time into the bot to make the changes. Thanks to everyone who supported me. I will bring the bot offline soon; this repo will stay dormant.

I may make another bot if I have enough time.
