### Utillity: 

Queros can do many things, translate text, calculate simple equations, google stuff up, and more will be implemented.


### The best part, FUN!:

This bot has a lot of fun commands. You can manipulate images and run funny commands to do hilarious stuff. Check the help menu for all of them.


### Music: Queros has a simple music feature, allowing you to play, pause, shuffle, loop, etc. The bot uses music from youtube to play. Currently, the bot will only get the 1st item of a playlist, but will be fixed later.

Note: For loop, shuffle, and the override commands, you need Manage Server perms.
