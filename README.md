## What is Queros?
Queros (pronounced like kew-eros) is a Discord bot written in Python designed with moderation features, utillity, music, and other fun commands! 


### Moderation:

Queros comes equipped with basic commands for moderation. It has temp banning, text mute, vc mute, kick, warn, and logging for that. Currently, only banning supports temporary infraction, but vc mute and text mute will come soon.

To temp ban, run u.ban @user reason time unit_of_time (u.ban @user reason 1 hr) and the acceptable times are sec, min, hr, day, wk, mo, yr.

Queros has a built in anti-curse filter that can help with misbehaving people.

Queros has an toggleble channel and command feature to restrict some channels and commands from being used. 


### Utillity: 

Queros can do many things, translate text, calculate simple equations, google stuff up, and more will be implemented.


### The best part, FUN!:

This bot has a lot of fun commands. You can manipulate images and run funny commands to do hilarious stuff. Check the help menu for all of them.


### Music: Queros has a simple music feature, allowing you to play, pause, shuffle, loop, etc. The bot uses music from youtube to play. Currently, the bot will only get the 1st item of a playlist, but will be fixed later.

Note: For loop, shuffle, and the override commands, you need Manage Server perms.
